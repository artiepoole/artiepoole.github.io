			<h2>About Me</h2>
		</header>
		<p>My name is Stu Poole. I am a highly practical and well rounded postgraduate researcher in Spintronics at the
		 School of Physics and Astronomy at The Univeristy of Nottingham. I have already undertaken many personal 
		 projects in electronics, woodworking and 3D modelling/design but am always willing to jump in the deep end. 
		 Below you will see a timeline and summary of these projects with links to find out more.</p>

					<h3>Early Life</h3>
				</header>
				<p> I grew up in the South East of England before moving to Nottingham to study an 
                integrated masters in Physics. Throughout school, I was interested in STEM subjects and making things. 
                My first experience with code was using Lua in a Minecraft mod with my brother and my first (documented, 
                personal) woodworking project was the headphone and controller rack pictured beside but I had made 
                several small things before this. The rack was posted to <a href="https://reddit.com">reddit</a> and 
                received over a million views!</p>

					<h3>Third Year Project</h3>
				</header>
				<p>During my third year at university, I undertook two research projects under 
				<a hred="https://twitter.com/JamesSSharp">James Sharp's</a> supervision. The first was an attempt to 
				measure the elastic modulus of a thin film by cutting it into an annulus, floating it on soapy water and
				 taking pictures of it. It required solving an unwieldy elasticity equation from first principles, 
				 developing an image analysis algorithm and delicate practical skills.</p>

				</ul>
                <p>The second was a summer internship in which Adidas sponsored us to try and measure the pressure 
                distribution and contact forces on the sole of a shoe during exercise. They hoped this would help with 
                rapid prototyping. To measure these forces, a piece of acrylic is illuminated such that the light is 
                totally internally reflected throughout the resulting waveguide. Whenever an object makes contact with 
                the surface, the object introduces an interface with a different refractive index and causes light to 
                be scattered through the waveguide to the awaiting camera. </p>

					<h3>Stu the Builder</h3>
				</header>
				<p>During my time as an undergraduate, I spent any holidays and free time working for my landlord's 
				contracted builder. Together, we refurbished student houses (including fitting en suites, removing 
				walls, stripping plumbing and replacing the roof of a dodgy loft conversion) and built extensions for 
				other clients. I was primarily involved in groundworks and roofing for the other clients but also helped
				 with interior works on one build.</p>

					<h3>Antiferromagnets and CuMnAs</h3>
				</header>
				<p> The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spintronics">spintronics</a> group at the University of 
				Nottingham is split into two groups: ferromagnetic spintronics, headed by 
				<a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/physics/people/andrew.rushforth">Andrew Rushforth</a>, and 
				antiferromagnetic (AFM) spintronics of which I am a part. AFM spintronics includes my supervisors, 
				<a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/Physics/People/kevin.edmonds">Kevin Edmonds</a> and
				 <a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/physics/people/peter.wadley">Peter Wadley</a> and is part of a 
				 large international collaboration centered around the 
				epitaxially grown thin film collinear antiferromanget, CuMnAs. When grown in the tetragonal phase, 
				CuMnAs <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1087947713284700550&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5">demonstrates 
				switching characteristics</a> which may prove to be applicable in low power and higher frequency 
				computing than is currently available.</p>

					<h3>Spin Flop</h3>
				</header>
				<p> My masters thesis and the following year and half of PhD work were focussed on observing and 
				understanding the phenomenon of spin flop in CuMnAs, hoping to find the values of the exchange and 
				anisotropy fields for use in theoretical sumulations of the dynamics and to furhter our understanding of
				 AFMs in general. I have attempted to use three techniques to measure spin flop and another was 
				 conducted within the group. Overall, only one was unsuccessful, yet we still have questions and have 
				 not solved for the relevant field strengths yet. My first technique was performed in my masters thesis,
				  using the deflection caused by the moments in the material to determine the orinetation of the AFM 
				  moments. This technique only measures relative changes and does not tell us much about the behaviour 
				  of moments as a whole. The technique conducted by the group involved measuring the difference in 
				  absorption of X-rays at two different polarisations and at two different energies in what's called 
				  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.diamond.ac.uk/Instruments/Techniques/Spectroscopy/XMLD.html">XLMD-PEEM</a>. 
				  This particular set up was only surface sensitive and posed the question "does spin flop occur 
				  throughout the material or just at the surface?". These works are detailed in the masters thesis and spin flop paper below.</p>

                <p>The other two approaches are both sensitive to changes throughout the thickness of the layer. One 
                involved high power, ultrafast physics and the other involved mangetic neutron scattering. Click the
