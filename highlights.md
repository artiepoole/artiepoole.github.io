			<h2>About Me</h2>
		</header>
		<p> I am a highly practical and well-rounded physicist, having studied antiferromagnetic spintronics and magnetooptics for my PhD (viva pending) at the University of Nottingham. During the PhD, I discovered that designing new equipment, setting up new experiments and doing these experiments is the most enjoyable part for me. Therefore, I am aiming to adopt a role as a technician or to work in equipment/instrument design with the aim of contributing to science in ways I am most suited to. I have undertaken many personal projects involving mechanical design, electronics and programming in various languages, and I am always willing to jump in the deep end to learn new practical skills. With access to my dad's workshop and some tools of my own, I undertake woodworking projects as a hobby and have worked as an assistant to a builder/joiner and renovated houses and built extensions, developing a very board suite of skills and varied understanding of how things work, which have been demonstrated as remarkable applicable to the laboratory environment. This page provides a summary of my PhD research, followed by examples of four projects, each primarily showcasing: equipment design skills, woodwork, electronics knowledge and programming skills, followed by a bit more about me.</p>

                    <h3>Research - New Characterisation Techniques for Thin Film Antiferromagnetic Materials </h3>
                </header>
                <p> 
                During my PhD in experimental spintronics and magnetooptics at the University of Nottingham, I have experience with many experimental techniques for magnetic characterisation such as transport measurements and magnetooptical measurements. My research focussed on studying CuMnAs as an example of an antiferromagnet (AFM) with promise in spintronic applications with it's relatively low resistance and ability to be switched electrically. My studies can be categorised into three main types of experiment: optical pump probe measurements, magnetoresistive electrical measurements and transport measurements (it would also be possible to break down my research into three major aims: to understand spin flop; to improve switching and electrical readout signals; and to understand the domain structure and domain formation in CuMnAs). Other smaller experiments were also conducted and I also spent a lot of my time assisting other researchers with their experiments while I was waiting for parts or equipment availability.
                </p>
                <p>
                Spin flop is a sudden reorientation of antiferromagnetic moments which occurs above some threshold field when an external magentic field is applied along the easy axis of the sample. This reproducible and predictable method of reorientation of magnetic moments is ideal for demonstrating the magnetic origin of phenomena which may be applicable to new AFM characterisation techniques. Before studying spin flop using neutron diffraction, the full volume extents of spin flop were not known. By using magnetic neutron diffraction to detect the change in amplitudes of diffraction peaks, the full thickness extent of spin flop was detected as 98 % at 8 T, increasing confidence in the use of spin flop as a test of characterisation techniques.
                </p>
                <p>
                The optical pump probe experiments were performed with the aim of demonstrating asyncrhonous optical sampling (ASOPS) as a convenient and rapid way of characterising the anisotropy of an AFM sample by using a heating pump pulse to induce demagnetisation in the material which is detected as a reduction in the polarisation angle change induced resulting from the Voigt effect. This same measurement process was also performed in collaboration with TU Dortmund, Germany, using a delay line pump probe technique which detected spin flop as a change in the magnitude of this demagnetisation related Voigt effect polarisation angle change to unambiguously demonstrate that the signals are of magnetic origin.
                </p>
                <p>
                The electrical switching possibilities of CuMnAs were first demonstrated in 2015, and since then, there has been an upsurge in interest in CuMnAs and its possible applications. To this end, many studies have investigated the origins and possible alternative mechanisms for both switching and readout. Typically anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) is used as the readout signal to detect magnetic changes induced by current pulses but these signals are small. I performed various switching experiments and also used short-duration high-power pulses with simultaneous measurement to detect larger signal changes with the aim of detecting the steady state anisotropy of a sample without the need for magnetic fields to induce some changes. These studied led to the discovery of a new mechanism capable of generating much larger resistance change signals than expected.

                Below are links to a paper summarising the neutron diffraction studies, a review article summarising AFM spintronics and the first paper demonstrating electrical switching and readout using CuMnAs.

					<h3>Equipment Design</h3>
				</header>
				<p>I have drawn many individual parts in CAD, and made several larger assemblies. Several of the smaller parts have been 3D printed, such as a replacement handle for a Black and Decker workmate workbench and a controller for an Atari 8-bit computer from the '80s. In many of my projects you can see evidence of CAD and progression in skills using it. Recently I have focussed on learning best practices and trying to form good habits. For the following project, I drew a CAD model in the final size and had it manufactured by the in-house workshop at UoN and LewVac.</p>
				<p> As an example of my design skills, I present my room temperature system: I was tasked with designing a high vacuum system with stable temperature control for measuring eletrical devices at and near to room temperature for the Spintronics group. The stability is required to eliminate drift in resistance measurements and to cool the sample when under load. There were three main points in the brief:
				<ul>
				<li>The temperature of the sample space has to remain within 0.1°C of the set point which can be anywhere between 0°C and 50°C.</li>
				<li>The sample, mounted to a 12 pin circular header, must be in high vacuum (10<sup>-5</sup> mBar) and have good thermal contact with the sample space with minimal thermal lag to the temperature control mechanism.</li>
				<li>The measurement wires should be shielded from electrical noise.</li>
                </ul>
                It turns out that we achieve:
				<ul>
				<li> Temperature stability within 0.005°C in a range from -10 to 60°C.</li>
				<li>The vacuum reaches (10<sup>-8</sup> mBar) and the thermal lag is less than a minute from Peltier to sample, with no drift in temperature throughout measurement</li>
				<li>The crosstalk is not noticeable as larger than usual measurement noise.</li>
                </ul>
                I designed the vacuum chamber, heatsink and control box and then wrote a custom python interface for the control box to hide a lot of the dangerous settings available in the proprietary software for the temperature controller supplier. A Peltier device was chosen as the temperature control mechanism because it can be used to both heat and cool the sample space. Click the link below to find out why this made the design so challenging and to learn more about the system's applications. A scientific paper describing the key features and operating parameters is in preparation.

                </header>
                <p>I really like to make things (as if that wasn't already clear) and one of the easiest materials to get started with is wood because the materials are readily available, and it is possible to do a lot of things with few expensive tools (by using hand tools). It is for this reason that most of my projects are woodworking, not because it is my favourite. To get where I am now, I learned most of what I know from my dad but also worked as a joiner's labourer during many of my undergraduate holidays. Recently I have been working on earrings to hone my skills with hand tools. When I head home to visit my parents. Over a Christmas break, my dad and I made a <a href="/projects/#Crokinole_Board" target="_blank">crokinole board</a> (a tabletop game somewhere between curling/boules and pool with DNA from shuffleboard and air hockey) to play with family and friends. The following year we made a <a href="/projects/#Chess_Board" target="_blank">chess board</a>. It is always a joy to have access to his tools, knowledge and company.</p>

                </header>
                <p>I have undertaken many small electronics projects, such as replacing a power supply in an old BBC Master computer, making cables or analogue filters for laser experiments and the box for the temperature controller in the RT system. The two other largest projects are a cartridge emulator for Atari 8-bit series computers using, an Arduino Mega, with plans to replace it with a PIC after the proof of concept stage, and a display board demonstrating the function of an 8-bit adder for outreach purposes. I have also focused on hardware-software interfacing in programming for my research and in my contribution to hackathon entries (see <a class="scrolly" href="#programming">Programming</a> for more on hackathons) but I helped with all the circuitry in those projects (where applicable). My most impressive electronics project is the following LED driver.</p>
                <p>Two-wire LED drivers work by oscillating the polarity of a driving DC current applied to a string of LEDs with sections of opposing polarity LEDs. This allows for easy assembly and control of the LEDs for animations etc. for Christmas lights. Typically, the controllers come programmed with several fun animations however they were all too bright and I just wanted adjustable soft lighting. I wanted to make a simple dimmable LED string driver for a 2-wire LED chain. As always, things got out of hand and the project ended up quite sophisticated. See the image on the right for a sneak-peak and click below to find out more.</p>

                    <h3>Programming</h3>
                </header>
                <p>I've been writing code as a hobby since my first week at university, mostly for scientific purposes but also at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon">hackathons</a> (24 hour programming/hardware competitions) and for fun. My teams and I are very proud to say that we won prizes at most of the hackathons we attended and typically stood out as the only hardware projects on display. Our projects include an Amazon Alexa controlled robot Budweiser box and a dice rolling app for the (now discontinued) Pebble Classic smartwatch. During my PhD, I created an <a href="https://github.com/stupoole/Instruments">instrument control package</a> containing classes for each instrument used regularly and methods to control them in typical applications. The classes also provide a way to control the instruments in unique ways. For this package, I also wrote scripts which utilise the package as <a href="https://github.com/stupoole/instrumentsexamples">examples</a> and to be used/modified for standard experiments. I also adapted code into a script capable of automatically correcting for drift in XMLD-PEEM imaging experiments.</p>
                <p>My most significant programming projects are this website and the instruments package written for my research group which is an interface for controlling the equipment used by the group. One other programming endeavour, however, is a game system called Balding Gate (working title, a play on Baldur's Gate) which I am working on with my brother. Neither of us are artists to please excuse the "gamer art" aesthetic.</p>
                <p>Balding Gate is a tool which hopes to simplify the combat of Dungeons and Dragons and similar tabletop role playing games by combining map drawing features, character editors and the ability to play out the combat as a co-op multiplayer video game. This tool aims to assist players and dungeon masters alike by reducing the amount of time spent explaining the combat situation, instead simply playing it out as a video game, allowing for the players to get back to the fun parts.</p>

If you're wondering what kind of person I am, and how I find time for these alongside my studies and life, you'll be glad to hear that I have a healthy work-life balance, with a less healthy interest in specialty coffee, finding time to cook and eat world foods, play board games and video games, socialise with friends, listen to a lot (and I mean a lot) of different music, read books (sci-fi and fantasy novels lately), and go on adventures: hiking in the woods, hiking up mountains, climbing up rock faces and exploring new cities. When not being active, I spend my time watching educational YouTube, often in niche subjects e.g. organic chemistry syntheses, machining and botany, but also in more typical subjects. </p>
