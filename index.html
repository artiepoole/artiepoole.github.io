			<h2> University </h2>
			<p> I am a Physicist at The University of Nottingham.</p>
			<h3> Academic Interests </h3>
			<p> I am mostly interested in nanoscience and related theory. I work in the spintronics group which requires understanding of nanomagnetism, nanoelectronics, solid state physics and nanofabrication, among other topics. Engineering and design, however, have always been interests of mine</p>
			<h3> Hobbies </h3>
			<p> I have always been interested in designing and making. From a young age, I have helped my dad with his DIY projects, such as extending our entrance hall, replacing the shower and tiling the front step and now I work part time as in maintenance and building. As a hobby, I work with electronics, such as designing a . Since then I have made a double bed, an elegant headphone stand and designed a desk to house three screens and my computer. The desk was never made, because I moved to university before I had the money for the materials. I intend to make it when I move to a more permanent residency.</p>
			<p> When not designing and making physical things, I am writing code and making programs/learning new programming languages. I was told that Haskell was an interesting language because it can be used to do proofs. I didn't understand how that was possible, forcing me to learn how it's possible. Since then I have learnt Haskell to a basic level. In python, I am using the anaconda package for the Scientific Computing module, and using the inbuilt packages to learn how to properly write object oriented programs. To do this, I am writing a text based adventure, in a cyberpunk/<a href="http://www.shadowruntabletop.com/">Shadowrun</a> setting but with the functionality of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork">Zork</a>. </p>
			<h3> Hackathons and Programming </h3>
			<p> In the past two years I have attended several Major League Hacking events, called hackathons, in which participants form teams and write the best program they can in the space of 24hrs. These are amazing opportunities to learn how to code and to meet people from different universities, and sometimes even countries. The events are usually sponsored by major tech companies such as Dell or Intel and PayPal. </p>
			<p>In the first hackathon I ever attended, my team and I designed an app to roll multiple dice on a Pebble Smartwatch. A string of letters and operators were typed on an app on the phone and then at the press of a button it would be sent to the watch. The watch would then roll the dice when the watch detected a sharp movement (such as the act of rolling dice) and would generate and display the result from the appropriate dice rolls. According to evidence, many of the judges from Pebble played role-playing games and thought this idea was brilliant, because the team all won the category and we all received Pebble Classic smartwatches.</p>
			<h3> Societies </h3>
			<p> In my first year I joined many societies and found them to be a great place to meet like minded people. From those societies, I have stuck with Sci-fi and fantasy film and book society, HackSoc and alternate music society (which has a lot of overlap with rock music society and punk society). In second year I was the treasurer for RockSoc (the rock music society) and had a great time.</p>
			<h2> Wood Working Projects </h2>
			<p>The three woodworking projects I am most proud are the coffee table designed to store school work (lots of A4 paper) and my laptop, the <a href="http://imgur.com/a/OUr19">folding bed/futon</a> I slept on for several years and the <a href="http://imgur.com/a/J5PW4">headphone and controller stand</a>, which is a combination of solid pine and oak plywood.  All of these were designed in CAD software; I originally used SolidWorks because my secondary school provided both the software and basic training. I have since invested time into AutoCAD which is much more challenging, less intuitive but much more powerful. </p>
			<p>Besides these three, I also made a keyboard <a href="http://imgur.com/a/62qFK">wrist wrest for my mechanical keyboard</a> and a Lego head inspired pen holder for my fountain pen. The keyboard wrist wrest was particularly challenging as the idea was to make it out of scrap material and offcuts. The piece we had for the wrest generated it's own challenges.</p>
