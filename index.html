			<h2> University </h2>
			<p> I am a 3rd year physics undergraduate at The University of Nottingham. My favourite modules so far have been <a href="http://modulecatalogue.nottingham.ac.uk/nottingham/asp/ModuleDetails.asp?crs_id=021493&year_id=000116">Scientific Computing</a>, <a href="http://modulecatalogue.nottingham.ac.uk/nottingham/asp/ModuleDetails.asp?crs_id=021485&year_id=000116">Principles of Dynamics</a> and <a href="http://modulecatalogue.nottingham.ac.uk/nottingham/asp/ModuleDetails.asp?crs_id=021484&year_id=000116"> Force and Function at the Nanoscale</a>.</p>
			<h3> Academic Interests </h3>
			<p> From the modules I have taken so far, I have discovered that I am primarily interested in theoretical physics, "word for coding" and nanoscience. Engineering and design, however, have always been interests of mine</p>
			<h3> Hobbies </h3>
			<p> I have always been interested in designing and making things. From a young age, I have helped my dad with his DIY projects, such as extending our entrance hall, replacing the shower and tiling the front step. After taking the resistant materials GCSE, gaining experience, I started to design woodworking projects to do at home. Since then I have made a double bed, an elegant headphone stand and designed a desk to house three screens and my computer. The desk was never made, because I moved to university before I had the money for the materials. I intend to make it when I move to a more permanent residency.</p>
			<p> When not designing and making physical things, I am writing code and making programs/learning new programming languages. I was told that Haskell was an interesting language because it can be used to do proofs. I didn't understand how that was possible, forcing me to learn how it's possible. Since then I have learnt Haskell to a basic level. In python, I am using the anaconda package for the Scientific Computing module, and using the inbuilt packages to learn how to properly write object oriented programs. To do this, I am writing a text based adventure, in a cyberpunk/<a href="http://www.shadowruntabletop.com/">Shadowrun</a> setting but with the functionality of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork">Zork</a>. </p>
			<h3> Hackathons and Programming </h3>
			<p> In the past two years I have attended several Major League Hacking events, called hackathons, in which participants form teams and write the best program they can in the space of 24hrs. These are amazing oppotunities to learn how to code and to meet people from different universities, and sometimes even countries. The events are usually sponsored by major tech companies such as Dell or Intel and PayPal. </p>
			<p>In the first hackathon I ever attended, my team and I designed an app to roll multiple dice on a Pebble Smartwatch. A string of letters and operators were typed on an app on the phone and then at the press of a button it would be sent to the watch. The watch would then roll the dice when the watch detected a sharp movement (such as the act of rolling dice) and would generate and display the result from the appropriate dice rolls. According to evidence, many of the judges from Pebble played roleplaying games and thought this idea was brilliant, because the team all won the category and we all recieved Pebble Classic smartwatches.</p>
