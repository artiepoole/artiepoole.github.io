<h1> Welcome Stu Poole's Homepage</h1>

<p>This is the home to a summary of hobbyist projects, research projects and, maybe at some point, some opinions pieces and other non-scientific written works. Please see the bottom of the page for links to other profiles such as research gate and github. </p>

<h2> Still to come:</h2>
<p>This website is still lacking any mention of my many hackathon (24 hour programming and making competition) attempts, ludemdare game jam entries, a summary of scientific and hobbyist programming work or the interactive tabletop system I am working on with my brother. Please see github for more information on this sort of thing. There is only limited information on my current research since I am not comfortable sharing anything that is not yet published as it is not only my work.</p>

<h2> Please note:</h2> 
<p>this website is still very much a work in progress and that the content is primarily filler with little to no proof-reading. You have been warned.</p>
