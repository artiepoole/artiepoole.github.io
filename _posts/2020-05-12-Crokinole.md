Board games are great, and modern board games are awesome, but they have some major drawbacks. Finding people who are committed enough to learn a complicated (and therefore rewarding) board game can prove difficult, and teaching it even more so. That's why the most popular board games (apart from chess) are so simple; that's their appeal. Crokinole appears to be both incredibly rewarding, simple to teach and quick to play. I have wanted to get a Crokinole board since watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMKzeg78peg">this video</a> in 2019. A Crokinole board, however, is definitely not cheap and is very awkward to store. I was hoping to make one to play with family over Christmas and so I drew the tournament specifications for the board in CAD and made a model to work from. I have not managed to source good enough quality ply wood so this has been postponed as a project but the files provided are free for anyone else to use and borrow so long as you credit me whenever you post the results.
