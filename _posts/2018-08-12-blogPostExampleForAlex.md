<h1> This is the biggest header </h1>
<h2> This is the second biggest </h2>
<h3> It gets smaller with bigger numbers after the h </h3>

<a href="youtube.com/alex"> this is a link to a youtube channel that doesn't exist</a>

<a href="/relative/file/location.png" target="_blank"><img src="/relative/file/location.png" alt="this text shows if the image fails"></a> Now the image is a link to itself so if you click it opens full screen in a new tab.

<ul> 
	<li> the ul tag begins a listing</li>
	<li> the li tag is a list entry</li>
	<ul>
		<li>this is a list inside a list</li>
	</ul>
</ul>
