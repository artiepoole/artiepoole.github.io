    <p> I wanted a website to host photos of projects on and to be able to easily share the things I have made in a style similar to a blog. This website has since evolved to include a highlights page which serves as a sort of summary of my achievements.</p>
    <p>This website uses a heavily modified template which uses Jekyll and GitHub pages. The original theme is from <a url="https://html5up.net/">HTML5 UP</a> template which was converted to use Jekyll by Andrew Banchich. To this template, I have added pop-up images and gallery support. I have also changed several of the default layouts to suit my purposes.</p>

<ul class="actions">
    <li><a class="button" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/artiepoole/artiepoole.github.io"><span class="fab fa-github"></span> View on GitHub</a></li>
</ul>
