<p> I am currently conducting research for my PhD in Antiferromagnetic Spintronics and Magneto-optics. If these terms are new to you, there are two reviews linked which should bring you up to speed. For the spintronics aspect, I have contributed designs and have commissioned a room temperature vacuum system which should allow for very stable control of temperature at temperatures close to room temperature using Peltier devices.</p>
<p>This will be used in switching experiments (see switching paper) where a current is applied to an biaxial CuMnAS layer in order to re-orient the magnetic moments in a reproducible and reversible manner. When applying the current pulses and measurement current, the system is heated. The room temperature system aims to act as a rapidly responding heat sink to reduce the heating and thereby reduce that contribution to the switching signal and to avoid damage. See this post to learn more about the system. For the magneto optics I have been measuring the Voigt effect in optical pump probe experiments while attempted to spin flop and electrically switch the devices. So far the magnetic ordering has been detected optically, reproducing the Voigt effect paper linked to the right. The spin flop and switching experiments have not yet yielded any convincing results but there are many ideas still to be implemented. The spin flop works are in collaboration with TU Dortmund.</p>
