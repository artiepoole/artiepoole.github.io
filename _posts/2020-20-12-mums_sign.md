My mum asked my brother and I to each make her a sign for her allotment. Her plots are 51-53 and so I decided I was going to make her a sign that said "Plot 51 - trespassers will be composted" but in the end decided against making the second part.

The process was simple: source some wood, trace the letters using carbon copy paper, carve them out, paint the letters, sand off the spill and finally finish with outdoor wood stain. The only hiccup was that we didn't have any carbon copy paper any more... I had to carve the letters out using a knife which turns out to be quite the challenge. My dad recently got himself a small trim router so I used this with an end-mill style bit to carve the letters and used a v-carving bit to carve the little spade/fork design (which was drawn in AutoCAD) . I painted in the letters using black gloss paint and used a hand plane to remove the paint that spilled outside the grooves. This resulted in a clean edge to the letters.
