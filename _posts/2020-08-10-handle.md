My dad gave me some (very much appreciated) hand me down tools including a workmate style folding workbench. The first time I used it however, one of the vice handles snapped. I decided to 3D print a replacement handle but I wanted to increase the strength at the point of failure. I drew the part in Autocad Inventor and ended up with a handle at a similar weight to the original but with much more meat on the bone. It was printed in PLA with 30% infill by my friend and his printer. The fit was perfect (better than stock in my opinion) and the handle works a charm! If you happen to have the same workbench, or want to use my file as a starting point, the CAD file is available below.
