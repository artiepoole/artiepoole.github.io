    <p>I started writing an operating system (OS) by following the <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org" target="_blank">OSdev.org</a> <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/Bare_Bones" target="_blank">bare bones tutorial</a>. In order to progress beyond this "hello world" result, I have had to drastically improve my competence with C, C++ and CMake. I had to learn AT&T and Intel assembly syntax, teach myself about manual linking and have had to implement various bare metal CPU controls.</p>
    <p> At the time of writing, the OS boots using a pre-made grub multiboot configuration and the kernel provides stdout, stderr and the ability to get and draw to a pixel frame buffer. using 32-bit colour (unused transparency). The primary goal of this project is to implement a public domain C library in order to run a <a href="https://github.com/ozkl/doomgeneric" target="_blank"> freeware version of DOOM</a>. There are many basic syscalls currently missing but they are being added one at a time.</p>
