<p>Headphone stands are pretty commonplace in home-offices, especially in the houses of audiophiles and gamers. There are countless horror stories of gamers running over their headphone wire and ruining their overpriced, bass-washed headphones; typically more LED than speaker cone... A very similar problem occurs with controller cables, especially those pesky xbox 360 controllers that are so commonplace (at the time of making). In order to escape the risk of damaging my headphones or controllers, I decided to design and make a simple wooden rack to house them, and their wires. After I decided the front of the rack should be slanted, the controllers should be held from the bottom and that I wanted to use a lathe, I drew the simple design, picture right, in CAD (well, sketch-up.. I couldn't get better free CAD software in 2015 without pirating.)

For this design, keeping the angle on the bevel and making back-up references was the only way to ensure that the cable caddies could be parallel to the bottom and flush with the front panels. Solid pine was chosen for the front and bottom pieces and the caddies were made from 7-layer marine ply left-over from the <a href="#">bed project</a>.</p>
<p>
The most challenging part of the build was definitely the clamping. Turns out ~12Â° is not an easy angle to hold things at.

Once it was glued up, it was coated in a few coats of linseed oil, sanding in between coats. The final product, pictured right, has seen continuous use since it's build and has survived many moves during study. Overall, a fantastic product.
