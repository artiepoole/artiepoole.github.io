At the time of making this, I had just lost my laptop and was waiting on the Lenovo t420 I knew I was getting for christmas. In the interim, I needed a way to SSH into the server my brother and I were sharing (primarily to host game servers on to play together). A phone wouldn't do since the screen was too small and the phone I had at the time was so pathetic. I have a knock-off Chinese tablet that I still occasionally use and it supported USB-OTG (On The Go)! This meant that, with the appropriate adapter, a keyboard and mouse could be used to control the device. With this in mind, and after struggling to find an ergonomic way to use the tablet with a keyboard, I set about making a tablet stand that doubled as a wrist wrest for the WASD keyboard I had (and still have).

The "kablet stand" as I called it is pictured right, where I was not using a mouse anymore since a touchscreen was more than sufficient.
