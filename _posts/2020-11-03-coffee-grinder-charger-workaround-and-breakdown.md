The coffee grinder we use in the office is a cheap rechargeable burr grinder and, for a long time, it was working well. At some point all micro-USB charging cables failed to charge the grinder. I figured, since mini-USB and micro-USB are both known to have short lifespans, that the port was damaged or broken. I couldn't find a teardown online and it is not clear how to proceed after removing the grind stone housing. It was not clear whether the top or the bottom should be pried off, and so the image gallery for this post is a simple tutorial for disassembling this grinder that is sold under many generic names (produced in china and resold under names in UK). It turns out that prying the top can lead to a ruined grinder, and prying the bottom requires more force that is comfortable but it is possible to pop the adjustment wheel off. In our case the usb port ground shield pins were both snapped so the port had sunk back into the pcb making any cable not reach the contacts. To fix this, I drilled a hole to add clearance for a cable to get closer and I reinforced the USB port with two part epoxy (initially I tried UHU multi purpose but it did not cure as hard as I expected).
