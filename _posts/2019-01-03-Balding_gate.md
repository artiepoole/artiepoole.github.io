<p>My brother and I started working on a game engine in Kotlin, as a way for us both to explore kotlin as a language and it's features. Although it has a working level editor and playable levels, development has been abandoned since the announcement of Baldur's Gate 3, a project with similar goals but with an infinitely larger budget.
