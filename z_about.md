					<h3>Early Life</h3>
				</header>
				<p> I grew up in the South East of England before moving to Nottingham to study an 
                integrated masters in Physics. Throughout school, I was interested in STEM subjects and making things. 
                My first experience with code was using Lua in a Minecraft mod with my brother and my first (documented, 
                personal) woodworking project was the headphone and controller rack pictured beside, but I had made 
                several small things before this. </p>

					<h3>Third Year Project</h3>
				</header>
				<p>During my third year at university, I undertook two research projects under 
				<a href="https://twitter.com/JamesSSharp" target="_blank">James Sharp's</a> supervision. The first was an attempt to 
				measure the elastic modulus of a thin film by cutting it into an annulus, floating it on soapy water and
				 taking pictures of it. It required solving an unwieldy elasticity equation from first principles, 
				 developing an image analysis algorithm and delicate practical skills.</p>

				</ul>
                <p>The second was a summer internship in which Adidas sponsored us to try and measure the pressure 
                distribution and contact forces on the sole of a shoe during exercise. They hoped this would help with 
                rapid prototyping. To measure these forces, a piece of acrylic is illuminated such that the light is 
                totally internally reflected throughout the resulting waveguide. Whenever an object makes contact with 
                the surface, the object introduces an interface with a different refractive index and causes light to 
                be scattered through the waveguide to the awaiting camera. </p>

					<h3>Stu the Builder</h3>
				</header>
				<p>During my time as an undergraduate, I spent any holidays and free time working for my landlord's 
				contracted builder. Together, we refurbished student houses (including fitting en suites, removing 
				walls, stripping plumbing and replacing the roof of a dodgy loft conversion) and built extensions for 
				other clients. I was primarily involved in groundworks and roofing for the other clients but also helped
				 with interior works.</p>

					<h3>Antiferromagnets and CuMnAs</h3>
				</header>
				<p> The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spintronics">spintronics</a> group at the University of 
				Nottingham is split into two groups: ferromagnetic spintronics, headed by 
				<a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/physics/people/andrew.rushforth">Andrew Rushforth</a>, and 
				antiferromagnetic (AFM) spintronics of which I am a part. The AFM spintronics group includes my supervisors, 
				<a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/Physics/People/kevin.edmonds">Kevin Edmonds</a> and
				 <a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/physics/people/peter.wadley">Peter Wadley</a> and is part of a 
				 large international collaboration centered around the epitaxially grown thin film collinear antiferromanget, CuMnAs. When grown in the tetragonal phase, 
				CuMnAs <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1087947713284700550&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5">demonstrates 
				switching characteristics</a> which may prove to be applicable in low power and higher frequency 
				computing than is currently available. The current state of research is focussing on understanding magnetic domain structures and their corresponding physical origins, topologically protected magnetic features and new characeterisation techniques for determining magnetic ansitropy, imaging domain structures and detecting electrically induced changes.</p>

					<h3>Spin Flop</h3>
				</header>
				<p> My Master's thesis and a significant part of my PhD work were focussed on observing, understanding and using the phenomenon of spin flop in CuMnAs, hoping to find the values of the exchange and anisotropy fields for use in theoretical simulations of the dynamics and to use spin flop as a useful test of new characterisation techniques. My first measurements of spin flop formed the basis of my Master's thesis, using anisotropic magnetoresistance transport measurements to detect the reoirentation of the moments. This technique only measures relative changes and does not tell us much about the behaviour of moments as a whole. The technique conducted by the group involved measuring the difference in absorption of X-rays at two different polarisations and at two different energies in what's called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.diamond.ac.uk/Instruments/Techniques/Spectroscopy/XMLD.html">XLMD-PEEM</a>. This particular set up was only surface sensitive and posed the question "does spin flop occur throughout the material or just at the surface?". This was answered by detecting spin flop in the bulk of the film using magnetic neutron diffraction. These works are detailed in the master's thesis and two peer reviewed articles below.</p>

					<h3>Magnetooptics</h3>
				</header>
				<p> I performed optical pump probe experiments with the aim of demonstrating asyncrhonous optical sampling (ASOPS) as a convenient and rapid way of characterising the anisotropy of an AFM sample by using a heating pump pulse to induce demagnetisation in the material which is detected as a reduction in the polarisation angle change induced resulting from the Voigt effect. This same measurement process was also performed in collaboration with TU Dortmund, Germany, using a delay line pump probe technique which detected spin flop as a change in the magnitude of this demagnetisation related Voigt effect polarisation angle change to unambiguously demonstrate that the signals are of magnetic origin.</p>

					<h3>Transport measurements</h3>
				</header>
				<p> The electrical switching possibilities of CuMnAs were first demonstrated in 2015, and since then, there has been an upsurge in interest in CuMnAs and its possible applications. To this end, many studies have investigated the origins and possible alternative mechanisms for both switching and readout. Typically anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) is used as the readout signal to detect magnetic changes induced by current pulses but these signals are small. I performed various switching experiments and also used short-duration high-power pulses with simultaneous measurement to detect larger signal changes with the aim of detecting the steady state anisotropy of a sample without the need for magnetic fields to induce some changes. These studied led to the discovery of a new mechanism capable of generating much larger resistance change signals than expected.</p>
